##### Data set used - SC-LC.TXT (each row in the dataset is a 'graph edge' written as, node node weight_of_edge). [(downloaded from protein-protein interaction  databases)](https://www.inetbio.org/wormnet/downloadnetwork.php).
##### Brief description of the problem
- The problem requires to create network from given data set and to manipulate, visualize and analyze the  network created.  
- The network size with more than 2000 nodes and 20000 edges makes it challenging to generate efficient  visual plots. Saving the visual plots as pdf file makes it easier to zoom the graphics and read the node labels.
